(ns pyramid.core
  "A library for storing graph data in a Clojure map that automatically
  normalizes nested data and allows querying via EQL.

  Create a new db with `db`. db values are normal maps with a tabular structure.

  Add new ones using `add`.

  Entities are identified by the first key with the name \"id\", e.g.
  :person/id. Adding data about the same entity will merge them together in
  order of addition. To replace an entity, `dissoc` it first.

  NOTE: Collections like vectors, sets and lists should not mix entities and
  non-entities. Collections are recursively walked to find entities.

  Query them w/ EQL using `pull`.

  To get meta-information about what entities were added or queried, use the
  `add-report` and `pull-report` functions."
